# Get ourselves near a professional and a lot of machine tools
Who are the professionals?
- university professors
-  engineers
-  machinists
- pro-sumer grade hobbyests (`this old tony` and `adam savage`)

Where are the machines?
- machine shops
- university laboratories
- professional homes/ garages

University has a rather high entry barrier so I think the best way through is to get to the hobbyists professionals in a as close to home setting as possible.
This also means we should get to a machine shop with as few employees possible. Because if we don't then we have to ask the owner to make a difficult decision.
To make money or to help us.
