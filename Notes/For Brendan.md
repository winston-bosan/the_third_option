- PRECISION MACHINISTS COMPANY INC
	- 25000 sqft/2500sqm of workshop space. Seems very impressive. (1000sqft per person on the generous side still means 25 people)

- Bristol Precision: too professional looking of a website
- Concept Tooling - ok at least wordpress, but a very soul-less website.

- Talco CNC - More of a distributor than a shop themselves 
- Jacobs Precision - Has enough machines I think they must have at least 30 people lol
